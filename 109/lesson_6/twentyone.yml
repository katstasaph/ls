rules_intro: "Twenty-One is based on the casino game Blackjack.\n\n"
rules_goal: |+
        The goal of Twenty-One is to beat the dealer by drawing a hand whose value 
           is as close as possible to #{score}, but no more.
           
rules_score: |+         
       Cards 2 through 10 of a suit are worth their face value.
          Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points.
          
rules_aces: "An Ace is worth 10 points, unless that would put your total points above %{score}."
rules_aces2: "If so, the Ace is worth 1 point.\n\n"

rules_chips: "You begin with %{chips} chips.\n\n"
rules_game: |+         
       Before each round, you may bet any amount of chips up to your total.
          Then, both you and the dealer are dealt two cards each.
          You can see both of your cards, but only one of the dealer's cards.

rules_moves: "If your initial draw is worth #{score} points, you win the round."

rules_moves2: |+
           Otherwise, after viewing both hands, choose a move:
       
               Hit: Draw one more card.
               Stay: Don't draw any more cards, just proceed to the showdown.
               Double down: Double your bet, draw one more card, proceed to the showdown.
               (You can't double down after hitting or if you don't have enough chips.)
          
             The dealer then chooses either to hit or stay.   

rules_winning: "If you reach exactly %{score} points, you win."
rules_winning2: |+
          If the dealer does, they win.
            
             If you go over, it's a bust and you lose. 
             If the dealer goes over, they lose.
       
             Otherwise, once both you and the dealer have stayed, you show your hands.
             The player with the higher total wins.
             In the case of a tie, your chips are refunded.
          
             If you run out of chips, you lose the match.
