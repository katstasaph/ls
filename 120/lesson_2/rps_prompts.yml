    During each round, you first choose a play from the following:
         (R)ock (P)aper (S)cissors (Sp)ock (L)izard
         
       The computer will then choose its play.
       Each computer personality has a different playstyle!
    
       Each play beats and is beaten by two others:
         Rock beats scissors and lizard
         Paper beats rock and Spock
         Scissors beats paper and lizard
         Lizard beats paper and Spock
         Spock beats rock and scissors
      
       If both plays are the same, the round is a tie.
    
       You score one point for each win and 0 points for ties.
       The first player to reach the victory total wins.
